    <p>Competitive friendship refers to relationships where friends push each other to excel in different areas of life, such as academics, sports, or careers. While this can be healthy and motivational, it can also lead to stress, jealousy, and tension if not managed well.</p>

    <p>On the flip side, if the competition turns unhealthy, it can cause jealousy, create feelings of inadequacy, or strain the friendship. It's important to maintain balance and ensure that the friendship remains supportive rather than overly competitive.</p>

    <p>To maintain a healthy competitive friendship, communication is key. Discuss boundaries, be supportive of each other's successes, and remember that each personâ€™s journey is unique. Healthy competition should always lead to mutual growth, not bitterness or rivalry.</p>
